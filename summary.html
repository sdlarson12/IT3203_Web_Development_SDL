        <p>Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is a key element in the history of web development. 
            It is the standard of web page creation to this day and enables developers to create web pages and embed 
            content<sup>1</sup>. Using tags within the HTML coding, a webpage can display content such as text and images<sup>2</sup>. 
            In conjunction with CSS, webpages display stylized content designed by a web designer and built by a web developer 
            for users to consume over the Internet. Despite advancements such as Web 2.0 and Mobile Web, the WWW still uses 
            HTML as its most basic language for creation of its web pages. </p>
