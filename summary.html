                <!--Research content for HTML and its significance in web development history-->
                <p id = "p">Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is a key element in the history of web development. 
                    It is the standard of web page creation to this day and enables developers to create web pages and embed 
                    content within them<sup>1</sup>. It exists on the server side and is provided to the client-side browser by a web server via HTTP request<sup>2</sup>.
                </p> 

                <p id = "p">Before the creation of HTML, the World Wide Web was brought to life by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN - the European Council for Nuclear Research - in 1989<sup>6</sup>.
                    At the time, there were scientists distributed around the world in their organization that found it necessary to share information over a reliable network 
                    in order to stay current with the latest research. In response to this problem, Tim Berners-Lee, alongside Robert Cailliau, outlined a document titled 
                    “Information Management, a Proposal” that suggested a network of hypertext documents could be viewed by users over the Internet. 
                    By the end of 1990, the first web server was created on a NeXT computer with a functional browser. CERN called this the World Wide Web, 
                    and HTML documents became available over this network. This significant milestone in web development history marks the availability of content 
                    in real-time all over the world.
                </p>
                
                <p id = "p">Using tags, or markups, within the HTML coding, a webpage can display content such as text and images<sup>2</sup>. 
                    Within these tags, hyperlinks to other web pages can also be included. This means that individual pages can be kept shorter and more focused, 
                    while the links make it easier for the user to navigate to the desired content.
                    In conjunction with styling using CSS, webpages display stylized content designed by a web designer and built by a web developer 
                    for users to consume over the Internet. Despite advancements such as Web 2.0 and Mobile Web, the WWW still uses 
                    HTML as its most basic language for creation of its web pages. The current version approved by the World Wide Web Consortium is HTML5.
                </p>

                <p id="p">Thanks to the implementation of later enhancements like CSS and JavaScript, HTML has made advancements in interactivity and design<sup>3</sup>.
                    More information on these enhancements is available in the Enhancements page linked above.
