                It is the standard of web page creation to this day and enables developers to create web pages and embed 
                content<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>Using tags within the HTML coding, a webpage can display content such as text and images<sup>2</sup>. 
                In conjunction with CSS, webpages display stylized content designed by a web designer and built by a web developer 
                for users to consume over the Internet. Despite advancements such as Web 2.0 and Mobile Web, the WWW still uses 
                HTML as its most basic language for creation of its web pages. The current version approved by the W3C is HTML5.</p>
                <p>Thanks to the advancements with XHTML and Web 2.0, HTML has made advancements in multimedia capabilities and simplicity in syntax<sup>3</sup>.</p>

                <p id = "p">In addition to its content maturation since inception, HTML has been enhanced by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and javascript.
                    CSS allows complex formatting that was limited with just HTML, and javascript adds a dynamic component where users can interact with the document.
                    These additions to HTML have made it into the web experience we know today.
