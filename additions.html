                <!--Research content for enhancements to HTML-->
                <p id = "p">In addition to its content maturation since inception, HTML has been enhanced by developments such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.
                    CSS allows complex formatting that was limited with just HTML, which includes modifications to color, backgrounds, and borders. 
                    While styling can be applied within the head tag on an HTML document, it is simpler to have one file with styling 
                    that applies to all pages within a website<sup>7</sup>. This ensures consistency between pages and 
                    clarity to any additional developers that perform maintenance or enhancements to the website at a later date.
                </p>
                <p id = "p">
                    CSS also allows grid and flexbox layouts, which can organize the HTML pages in a more functional and aesthetically pleasing way<sup>7</sup>. 
                    This feature of CSS allows webpages to be dynamically adjusted to match various screen widths using media queries<sup>9</sup>.
                    With various screen widths available between smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops, these layout components can adjust the width
                    or columnar arrangement to ensure that all content fits on a screen without the need for additional horizontal scrolling. 
                </p>
                <p id = "p">
                    In addition to the styling that CSS provides, Javascript adds a dynamic component where users can interact with the document<sup>8</sup>.
                    JavaScript can manipulate content on HTML documents such as text or images, process user inputs, call Application Programming Interfaces 
                    to pass or receive information, or producing a result as a consequence of a user action, such as a click or mouse hover. JavaScript can be implemented into 
                    and HTML document with the script tag.                    
                </p>
                <p id = "p">An example of JavaScript in action is shown to the left. A button tag with a JavaScript function 
                    changes the display of the text inside of the document. Without this added functionality, HTML would only be capable of displaying information as a document.
                    Thanks to enhancements like JavaScript, content becomes interactive and more engaging for users.
