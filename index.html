        <a href = "https://sdlarson12.github.io/IT3203_Web_Development_SDL/" >Home</a>
        <p>One significant advancement in the history of web development that deserves focused acknowledgement is the creation of use of Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML. It is the standard of web page creation to this day and enables developers to create web pages and embed content8. Using tags within the HTML coding, a webpage can display content such as text and images7. In conjunction with CSS, webpages display stylized content designed by a web designer and built by a web developer for users to consume over the Internet. Despite advancements such as Web 2.0 and Mobile Web, the WWW still uses HTML as its most basic language for creation of its web pages. </p>
